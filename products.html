		We have many options for dogs. We recommend the Blue brand dog food because not only is it
		the best priced food but its made with all natural ingrediants so that it is very health for 
		the dog. As far as apperal goes we have many different options of jackets for dogs. They come
		in all different size and colors as well as water proof and furr lined to keep the dogs dry and warm.
		</p>

		We also have many options for Cats. We have carpet towers that most cats love to play on. It gives them a 
		chance to dull there nails by climbing while also allowing the Cat to feel like hes in a natural habitat.
		We also have many options for toys such a little mice, small tennis balls, and knotted rope. We dont usually 	
		supply apperal for Cats because that is considered to be animal abuse as there has been studies that show
		cats do not like being dressed up.

	The last animal that we focus on are snakes. Personally as a co-founder of Durham House of Pets I picked our store
	to focus on these animals because of how much scrutiny they get. Theyre are really quite fascinating. We carry over 24 
	different types of snakes as well as all of the accessories needed to properly care for a snake. We have empty fish tankes	
	that are usually filled with leaves, or shredded paper for the snake to move about on. We also supply the food they need. For	
	a larger Python we recommoned baby mice or large insects. For the smaller Cobras we recommend insects and sometimes a larger mammal.
