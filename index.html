	A brief history of Durham House of Pets is that we started 
	about 15 years ago when my brother and I decided that we 
	had seen enough animal abuse and mistreatment of pets in our 
	society. We wanted to creat a business that was more beneficial
	for the pets and so came Durham House of Pets. In our stores
	we offer the safest toys, food, bedding, and accessories for dogs. 
	Through this idea that we had we were able to expand pretty quickly
	and opened up two other stores in New Hampshire. One is located 
	in Plymouth, NH and the other is located in Hanover, NH. At all
	three locations we serve the pet as the customer. The owner is 
	simply a mediator between the employees and the animals. This 
	insures that we keep the animals best interests in mind through 
	the sales of goods.
